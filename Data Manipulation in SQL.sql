-- CHAPTER 3 - CORRELATED SUBQUERIES

-- Basic Correlated Subqueries

-- Correlated subqueries are subqueries that reference one or more columns in the main query. 
-- Correlated subqueries depend on information in the main query to run, and thus, cannot be executed on their own.


-- correlated subqueries to examine matches with scores that are extreme outliers for each country -- above 3 times the average score!

SELECT 
	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	country_id,
    date,
    home_goal, 
    away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query by the subquery
	(home_goal + away_goal) > 
        (SELECT AVG((home_goal + sub.away_goal) * 3)
         FROM match AS sub
         -- Join the main query to the subquery in WHERE
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id);


-- Correlated subquery with multiple conditions

-- add an additional column for matching to answer the question -- what was the highest scoring match for each country, in each season?

SELECT 
	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	country_id,
    date,
    home_goal, 
    away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	-- Filter for matches with the highest number of goals scored
	(home_goal + away_goal) = 
        (SELECT MAX(sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal)
         FROM match AS sub
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id
               AND main.season = sub.season);

-- Nested simple subqueries

-- nested subquery to examine the highest total number of goals in each season, overall, and during July across all seasons.

SELECT
	-- Select the season and max goals scored in a match
	season,
    MAX(home_goal + away_goal) AS max_goals,
    -- Select the overall max goals scored in a match
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match) AS overall_max_goals,
   -- Select the max number of goals scored in any match in July
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) 
    FROM match
    WHERE id IN (
          SELECT id FROM match WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 07)) AS july_max_goals
FROM match
GROUP BY season;

-- Nest a subquery in FROM

-- What's the average number of matches per season where a team scored 5 or more goals? How does this differ by country?
-- step 1 - Generate a list of matches where at least one team scored 5 or more goals.

-- Select matches where a team scored 5+ goals
SELECT
	country_id,
    season,
	id
FROM match
WHERE home_goal >4 OR away_goal >4;

-- STEP 2 - COUNT the match ids generated in the previous step, and group the query by country_id and season.

-- Count match ids
SELECT
    country_id,
    season,
    COUNT(id) AS matches
-- Set up and alias the subquery
FROM (
	SELECT
    	country_id,
    	season,
    	id
	FROM match
	WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5) 
    AS subquery
-- Group by country_id and season
GROUP BY country_id, season;

-- STEP 3 - Calculate an AVG of high scoring matches per country in the main query.

SELECT
	c.name AS country,
    -- Calculate the average matches per season
	AVG(outer_s.matches) AS avg_seasonal_high_scores
FROM country AS c
-- Left join outer_s to country
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT country_id, season,
         COUNT(id) AS matches
  FROM (
    SELECT country_id, season, id
	FROM match
	WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5) AS inner_s
  -- Close parentheses and alias the subquery
  GROUP BY country_id, season) AS outer_s
ON c.id = outer_s.country_id
GROUP BY country;

-- COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS

-- You can list one (or more) subqueries as common table expressions (CTEs) by declaring them ahead of your main query, which is an excellent tool for organizing information and placing it in a logical order

-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list AS (
    SELECT 
  		country_id, 
  		id
    FROM match
    WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10)
-- Select league and count of matches from the CTE
SELECT
    l.name AS league,
    COUNT(match_list.id) AS matches
FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE to the league table
LEFT JOIN match_list ON l.id = match_list.country_id
GROUP BY l.name;

-- expand on the exercise by looking at details about matches with very high scores using CTEs. Just like a subquery in FROM, you can join tables inside a CTE.

-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list AS (
  -- Select the league, date, home, and away goals
    SELECT 
  		l.name AS league, 
     	m.date, 
  		m.home_goal, 
  		m.away_goal,
       (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN league as l ON m.country_id = l.id)
-- Select the league, date, home, and away goals from the CTE
SELECT league, date, home_goal, away_goal
FROM match_list
-- Filter by total goals
WHERE total_goals > 9;

-- Since many queries are written with the intention of being saved and re-run in the future, proper organization is key to a seamless workflow. Arranging subqueries as CTEs will save you time, space, and confusion in the long run!
-- Declare a CTE that calculates the total goals from matches in August of the 2013/2014 season.

-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list AS (
    SELECT 
  		country_id,
  	   (home_goal + away_goal) AS goals

    WHERE id IN (
       SELECT id
       FROM match

FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE onto the league table
LEFT JOIN match_list ON l.id = match_list.country_id
GROUP BY l.name;

-- Get team names with a subquery

-- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?
-- Out of the 4 techniques we just discussed, this can be performed using subqueries, correlated subqueries, and CTEs. 

-- STEP 1 LEFT JOIN TEAM TO MATCH
SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name AS hometeam
-- Left join team to match
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN team as t
ON m.hometeam_id = team_api_id;

-- STEP 2 - Add a second subquery to the FROM statement to get the away team name, changing only the hometeam_id. Left join both subqueries to the match table on the id column.

SELECT

-- STEP 2 - Declare the query from the previous step as a common table expression. SELECT everything from the CTE into the main query. Your results will not change at this step!

-- Declare the home CTE
WITH home AS (
	SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name AS hometeam
	FROM match AS m
	LEFT JOIN team AS t 
	ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id)

-- Correlated subqueries can allow you to circumvent multiple, complex joins.
-- Common table expressions are declared first, improving query run time.
-- Multiple or nested subqueries are processed first, before your main query.

-- CHAPTER 4 - Window Functions

-- Window function = class of functions that perform calcualtions on a result set that has already been generated (also referred as a window)
-- use window functions to perform aggregate calcualtions without having to group your data


-- The match is OVER

-- OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. 
-- The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions 

-- how many goals were scored in each match and how does this compare with the averag

SELECT 
	-- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
	m.id, 
    c.name AS country, 
    m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
    -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER() AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;

-- create a data set of ranked matches according to which leagues, on average, score the most goals in a match.

SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank each league according to the average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;

-- Flip OVER your results - i.e. order by desc now

SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank leagues in descending order by average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) DESC) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;

-- OVER WITH A PARTITION

-- PARTITION BY = allows you to calculate sperate values for different categories established in a partition
-- allow you to calculate different aggregate values within 1 column of data and pass them down a data set instead of having to calculate them in different columns

-- allows you to answer questions such as how many goals scored in each match and how does this compare to season average PARTITION BY season

-- creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League), the top ranked team in Poland, and comparing their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

	home_goal,
	away_goal,

    AVG(home_goal) OVER( season) AS season_homeavg,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_awayavg
FROM match
-- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673 
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;

-- calculate the average number home and away goals scored Legia Warszawa, and their opponents, partitioned by the month in each season.

SELECT 
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home'

-- used to aggregate one row at a time i.e. runningtotal, sums counts and averages
-- can be partioned by 1 or more columns
